"""Grokkers for Grok-configured components.

This `meta` module contains the actual grokker mechanisms for which the
Grok web framework is named.  A directive in the adjacent `meta.zcml`
file directs the `martian` library to scan this file, where it discovers
and registers the grokkers you see below.  The grokkers are then active
and available as `martian` recursively examines the packages and modules
of a Grok-based web application.

    When an application defines a `grok.REST` view, we do not actually
    register the view with the Component Architecture.  Instead, we grok
    each of its methods separately, placing them each inside of a new
    class that we create on-the-fly by calling `type()`.  We make each
    method the `__call__()` method of its new class, since that is how
    Zope always invokes views.  And it is this new class that is then
    made the object of the two configuration actions that we schedule:
    one to activate it as a REST adapter for the context, and the other
    to prepare a security check for the adapter.

    This results in several registered views, typically with names like
    `GET`, `PUT`, and `POST` - one for each method that the `grok.REST`
    subclass defines.
