"""Grok publication factories and classes.

These factories, and the publication classes they return, make Grok
security different from the way that security normal operates during
Zope publication.  Instead of security proxies being wrapped around
every object generated during traversal, and then wrapped around the
final object before it is viewed, only a single security check is done
when Grok is in charge: a check to see whether the view selected at the
end of the traversal process is, in fact, permitted to display the
object.
